# 2023-Assignments
Dump file of all my coding assignments

This is where I'm putting all of my CSE 1321L Assignments for Fall 2023. 
These aren't perfect, but I plan to put little notes next to them so that I can look back on them for future reference.
Or, if there's someone who happens to be struggling with one of these assignments, I want to be able to give them inspiration for their own solution.

I'm always looking for feedback! Please tell me if there's anything I can to to optimize my code!
